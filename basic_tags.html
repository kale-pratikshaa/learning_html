        <pre>anasaheb Priviwale of Pune witnessed the Ganpati festival in Valher, inspiring him to unite society for freedom. He introduced the concept in Pune, initially met with resistance due to the city's conservative reputation. Lokamanya Tilak convened a meeting, inviting Dagdusheth Halwai, the Nagarsheth of Pune, and Mayavars. They decided to celebrate the seven-day Ganpati festival at five city locations, with locals funding it. The response was so positive that Lokamanya Tilak urged the public to join, leading to a ten-day celebration in 1893. Dagdusheth Halwai introduced an environmentally-friendly idol, differing from traditional warrior Ganesha forms. This concept aimed to bless and protect society. Shri Naik crafted this idol, which became the symbol of the Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati Trust's Ganesh Utsav.</pre>
